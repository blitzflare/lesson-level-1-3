# Instructor Guide 

## 1. General project info
- **Levels covered:** levels 1 - 3.
- **Coding concepts covered:** basic html and css

This project provides students with an introduction to basic web development concepts.

**Please make sure that you have reviewed and have familiarized yourself with the project before starting it with a student.** 

## 2. Setting students up
**Setting students up with their project may require considerable up front effort, but is an extremely important part of the project process.** Taking the time to help students plan and layout their project in the beginning will give them and you a road map to follow as you work through their project together. Setting students up with projects is also intentionally designed to be a highly collaborative process between the instructor and the student.

  1. Start the project setup process with a conversation with the student about the project. Start by finding out what the student is interested in. Coming up with a project topic may take time and be difficult depending on the student. Once you and the student have agreed on a project topic help the student describe what the project is about, come up with a project name, identify the type of project and identify any research that will be needed.
  2. In the project guide there are sections where the student is able to describe the content they are adding to their tags. Filling these sections out in the beginning of the project will help to serve as an ongoing guide for the student and instructor(s). 
  3. There are also places in each section that ask for a scheduled date of completion, the instructor or coordinator's name and the student's name. At the beginning of the project the student and the instructor should agree on dates that each aspect of the project will be completed, enter those dates and enter their names. This helps with keeping students accountable.

## 3. Moving through the project
  1. As you move through the project with a student there are concepts with check boxes next to them. As the student completes each completes each concepts you and the student should check the box next to the concept to indicate that concept has been completed. 
  2. Some concepts will include a rating with three options (1. mastered this skill, 2. understands this skill, but could use reinforcement and 3. has not mastered this skill yet and reinforcement is needed). These ratings are based on your assessment of the students performance. 
  3. Once each section has been completed have the student enter the date that section was completed.

## 4. The end of the project
  1. Once the project has been completed please review the project with the student to get any feedback or thoughts they may have on that project or their next project.

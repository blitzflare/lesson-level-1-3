## 2. Setting students up
**Setting students up with their project may require considerable up front effort, but is an extremely important part of the project process.** Taking the time to help students plan and layout their project in the beginning will give them and you a road map to follow as you work through their project together. Setting students up with projects is also intentionally designed to be a highly collaborative process between the instructor and the student.

  1. Start the project setup process with a conversation with the student about the project. Start by finding out what the student is interested in. Coming up with a project topic may take time and be difficult depending on the student. Once you and the student have agreed on a project topic help the student describe what the project is about, come up with a project name, identify the type of project and identify any research that will be needed.
